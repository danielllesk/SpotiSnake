# 🎵 SpotiSnake

**SpotiSnake** is an innovative fusion of the classic Snake game and Spotify album listening. Eat apples, reveal the full artwork, and enjoy real-time music as you play!

## 🎮 Game Overview

SpotiSnake transforms your favorite albums into an interactive gaming experience:

- **🎯 Choose Your Album**: Search and select any Spotify album with cool artwork
- **🐍 Play as Snake**: Navigate and eat scattered pieces of fruit
